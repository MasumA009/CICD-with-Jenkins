# CICD

Continous integration, continous delivery.

continous integeration helps engineers, devs  and everyone collaborate together. 

webhook triggger: an automatic type of trigger that listens for a certain type of data, much like event triggers.

CICD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery). It is a set of practices and processes used in software development to automate the building, testing, and deployment of applications (more can be read here at semaphoreci)[https://semaphoreci.com/blog/cicd-pipeline].


Most software releases go through a couple of typical stages:
![Alt text](images/cicd-pipeline-introduction-1024x422-1.jpg)

1. In most cases, a pipeline run is triggered by a source code repository. A change in code triggers a notification to the CI/CD tool, which runs the corresponding pipeline.
2. We combine the source code and its dependencies to build a runnable instance of our product that we can potentially ship to our end users.
3. we run automated tests to validate our code’s correctness and the behavior of our product.
4. Once we have a built a runnable instance of our code that has passed all predefined tests, we’re ready to deploy it. There are usually multiple deploy environments.

# Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps in automating various tasks in software development, including building, testing, and deploying applications. Jenkins allows developers to automate repetitive tasks and facilitates collaboration within a development team.

Typical stages are:

1. building the application, 
2. running tests, 
3. deploying to a staging environment, 
4. deploying to production

More specifically, the stages we covered are:

1. the Multi-stage build, pipelines
2. The execution of shell
3. creation of enviornment variables, (Jenkins Enviornment and Node)
4. Store files in Jenkins, ( "file.pem" and "tech230-masum-Jenkins" )


# Other tools

1. GitLab CI/CD: GitLab provides an integrated CI/CD solution that is tightly integrated with its source code management platform.

2. CircleCI: CircleCI is a CI/CD platform that supports running jobs in Linux, macOS, and Windows environments.

3. TeamCity: TeamCity is a powerful CI/CD server developed by JetBrains, which supports a wide range of build and deployment configurations.

4. Azure DevOps: Azure DevOps (formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services) is a comprehensive set of development tools provided by Microsoft. It offers a range of CI/CD capabilities, including build pipelines, release management, and deployment automation.

## Create Jenkins Jobs

Jenkin jobs are the tasks we do in Jenkins. 

Select `New item`.. Enter details and select `Freestyle`:

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20121620.png)

ensure these are selected:

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20121757.png)

include this:

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20142513.png)


Scroll down to `Build` and select `Execute Shell`: 

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20121853.png)

to find the version, type:

```
uname -a
```

Apply and save it.

NOTE: We can edit it via `Confgure` :

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20125841.png)



navigate to `Build Now`, this essentially launches it:

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20122453.png)

It results in:

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20122520.png)

Select the dropdown:

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20122556.png)

Here is the console output:

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20122653.png)



## Multi-stage build - pipeline

Follow the steps as previous, but in the `Build`, type:

```
date
```

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20143710.png)

Save and run, select `Console Output`.

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20143803.png)

Results in:

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20143940.png)

navigate to the old build, and select `Post-build actions`.

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20144132.png)

select the right build;

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20144227.png)

and run,

Successfully automated a pipeline!



## linking key from Github to Jenkins

Navigate to the `app` folder on Github. Select Settings -> Deploy keys -> add key. Follow it through, adding the keys and names. 

remember to make an actual key on our local drive we have to run the following:

`cd` into `.ssh` and run:

```
 ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "masum-jenkins"
```

name it and we can use `cat` to look into the keys. 

Then, on Jenkins, create a new build with these settings:

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20150210.png)

add a new key:

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20152106.png)

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20152128.png)

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20150246.png)

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20150301.png)

After launching and deploying, i realaised the `cd app` command was causing an error, so i got rid of it;

```
npm install
npm test
```

the console resulted in:

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20150656.png)

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20150728.png)

The private key has been added to jenkins!

## 

select `configure` and change these:

In an effort not to modify the mster node, we use this:

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20152947.png)

Change the triggers:

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20153030.png)

Run it and.....

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20153703.png)

success!

## Adding a new webhook

on github, i naviagated to the `app` repo.

and putted in my Payload URL:

```
http://3.9.13.91:8080/github-webhook/
```

Follow these settings:

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-30%20161326.png)

i rechecked my Git credentials. 


## Setting up prodution enviornment 

Create a new instance with these sg:

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20110943.png)

Now the prduction line has been setup. 

##  CI segment: new Jenkins build

Create a new Build, im naming mine `Masum-ci`.

Input the correct Github link, i had to copy mine over to a repo for it to corrrectly work:

![Alt text](images-more/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20175432.png)

Next, add restriction:

this:
 
 ![Alt text](images-more/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20175612.png)


 i also  had to create a new `dev` branch, it was done by running:

```
git branch dev
```

In the terminal


I created a new build o Jenkins, following the same steps as above. 

the difference was:

![Alt text](images-more/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20175711.png)

the `Branch specifier` was `dev`. 

We can find how to add keys above^.


Select the `Github trigger`:

![Alt text](images-more/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20175815.png)

ensure you select `Provide Node... `

![Alt text](images-more/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20175919.png)

Under the build:

![Alt text](images-more/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20175955.png)


and then in the build itself;

under post actions:

![Alt text](images-more/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20180057.png)


ran with no issues!

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20115110.png)

## merge segment

in this part we will merge our dev branch wit master, this allows any chances that happen locally to be copied into master branch automatiaclly.

We need to ensure our webhook is working first:

Navigate to the app location on GIT, and chehck:

![Alt text](images-more/Screenshot%202023-06-01%20092409.png)

just like before, set-up a new build with these options:

![Alt text](images-more/Screenshot%202023-06-01%20091833.png)

The project URL is the same as we've been using,

add the restriction:

![Alt text](images-more/Screenshot%202023-06-01%20091943.png)

Add the Git repo:

![Alt text](images-more/Screenshot%202023-06-01%20092020.png)

under additional behaviours:

![Alt text](images-more/Screenshot%202023-06-01%20092050.png)

I didnt change anything on `Build triggers`, or `build enviornment`.

under post-build:

NOTE: We only add this after the production has been created. 

![Alt text](images-more/Screenshot%202023-06-01%20092154.png)

Finally:

![Alt text](images-more/Screenshot%202023-06-01%20092233.png)

## pushing to prodution

Launch a production line instance:

![Alt text](images/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20140501.png)

Create a new build on Jenkins with the same initial requirments:

Note, i had to move my `app` folder to another repo, this included changing every job on jenkins.

As we have been doing:

![Alt text](more-images/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20163817.png)

![Alt text](more-images/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20164138.png)

NOTE: this time we use `master` rather than `dev`

![Alt text](more-images/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20164200.png)

We include NodeJS and allow SSH,

![Alt text](more-images/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20164224.png)

Under `Execute Shell`:

```
rsync -avz -e "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" app ubuntu@ec2-54-194-35-201.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu
ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" ubuntu@ec2-54-194-35-201.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com <<EOF
    sudo bash ./app/provsion.sh
    cd /home/ubuntu/app
    npm install
    pm2 kill
    pm2 start app.js
EOF
```

Success!

Dry run testing:

By making a change locally, pushing it to GITHUB, and it automatically update the master repo and thereafter the Posts page:
